# Activism HUB
Extension of boilerplate webscraper by Ania Kubow

My first time messing around with webscraping, but hopefully useful for people!

Currently I have spun up a website using Heroku. If this scales maybe we will use something else?

www.activism-hub.com
## Goal

To provide a scraped collection of sites for activism, combined into one place

The aim is to be FUNCTIONAL! I'm not particularly concerned with a nice UI, however maybe I (or someone else) will add a frontend at some point, however I think currently its better to invest time into scraping more sites


## To run this project

You can run this project on your local machine. Just pull it down and do the following:

### `npm i`

1. Run the command above to install all the packages

### Start the Project

2. Now run the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:8000/results](http://localhost:8000/results) with your browser to see the results of the scrape in your terminal.

4. Finally, open the index.html file in your browser to see the results showing up.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request! I am new to web-scraping, and not an expert in javascript, so feedback is always appreciated! :D 

To add a site, scrape the event info from an organization into a JSON, then create a new page for it- have that page return the JSON of events.

Then, link that site on the main page!
